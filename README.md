*Helping the Dragonhack organizers make good choices*

To help the event organizers make the right choice picking out the teams that should go to the event, we decided to make a list of pros and cons for each one of our team members. 

## Žiga T.
➕ I know how to use all important programming languages (Python)

➕ my sleep schedule is irregular so I won't even notice not sleeping for 24 hours

➕ I work better under pressure

➕ I planted a pineapple

➕ this will be my first hackathon, so I will have beginner's luck 

<br/>

➖ my hair color is very unpredictable

➖ I don't work when not under pressure

➖ I don't know how to use Eventbrite bots

## Blaž R.
➕ I can do embedded so you can be sure someone will sign up for the niche challenges

➕ spent 4 years at FRI so far so I can keep an interested facial expression no matter what’s going on 

➕ I have 5 projects due the week after Dragonhack so you know I really want to be there

<br/>

➖ I know so many programming languages but don’t know how to speak to people

➖ quit drinking for a year but then decided to go for a masters

➖ pretty tall so I stick out in pictures

## Ana B.
➕ will not bother any of the company representatives because people scare me

➕ showered in the last 24h

➕ diversity

<br/>

➖ will not talk to any of the company representatives because people scare me

➖ I have a macbook so I can’t run any software 

➖ attended Dragonhack last year so if something goes wrong, I’ll notice

## Žiga R.

➕ I do uni assingments all day every day so a two-day hackathon is just an ordinary day for me.

➕ I shower daily.

<br/>

➖ Can't spam F5 fast enough.

➖ Understands computers more than people.
